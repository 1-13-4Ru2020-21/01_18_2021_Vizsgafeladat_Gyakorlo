	TypeScript - Operators
	What is an Operator?
	An operator defines some function that will be performed on the data. The data on which operators work are called operands. Consider the following expression:
	7 + 5 = 12
	Here, the values 7, 5, and 12 are operands, while + and = are operators.
	The major operators in TypeScript can be classified as:
		Arithmetic operators
		Logical operators
		Relational operators
		Bitwise operators
		Assignment operators
		Ternary/conditional operator
		String operator
		Type operator 
	Relational Operators
	Relational Operators test or define the kind of relationship between two entities. Relational operators return a Boolean value, i.e., true/ false.
	Assume the value of A is 10 and B is 20.
